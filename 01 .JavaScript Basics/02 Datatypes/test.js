"use strict" // to use modern or newer version of javaScript
//will be treated,  all js code as newer version

// alert(3+3) // this line will give us an error over IDE  --> but in browser ,It'll show a popup why?? ....because we're using node js

console.log(3+3) //output will be 6

//console.log(3+3) console.log("Ashim")  // this line giving me an error because node js can't differentiate between these two different lines .. btw you can use semicolon like:

//console.log(3+3); console.log("Ashim") //never try such stupid things because code readability is important ..never write like this ..It's okay but don't write

console.log(3+3) ;
console.log("Ashim");  //semicolon is optional in javaScript but It's supposed to be a good practice because almost programming language uses semicolon to terminate or end a statement of code

console.log(3+
    3) ; console.
    log("Ashim") // even you can write like this but  you know code readablity is important... so please take care of such stupid things.
